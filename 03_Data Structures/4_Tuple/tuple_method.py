#tuple = () ordered and unchangeable. Duplicates Ok. Faster 

fruits = ("apple", "orange", "banana", "coconut")
print(fruits) 

#tuple have only two methods
fruits.index("apple") #Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found
fruits.count("apple") #Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple
